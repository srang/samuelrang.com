This game had major playoff seeding implications with the undefeated Pittsburgh
Steelers facing off against their divisional rival, the Baltimore Ravens, whose
only loss on the year was to the defending Super Bowl champions. This game
lived up to the billing, coming down to the final play. The surprise here was
how un-Lamar-like Lamar Jackson looked, especially early in this game.

(TODO when was Lamar's last interception, what's an adjective for football
protective, PFF grades for the game) The second pass he threw in this game was
an ugly pick-six (TODO was this his first ever pick-six), later followed by a red-zone fumble, (TODO any other turnovers?) and that doesn't
include his other turnover-worthy plays: an overturned interception and a
self-recovered fumble. Even beyond the turnovers, Lamar struggled in designed
runs, which wouldn’t have been surprising against the best run defense in the
NFL, except that the rest of the Ravens running attack was highly effective. They
tallied 265 (TODO confirm doesn't include lamar) yards on the ground against a
team that had only allowed just over 400 rushing yards in their other six games
*combined*. To be fully transparent, a “bad” day of Lamar is still better than
almost any other NFL quarterback. He put up 208 yards through the air, 65 yards
on the ground (mostly on scrambles), and two TDs. The takeaway here isn’t that
Lamar or the Ravens are struggling, it’s that they have a very high ceiling and
even at their floor (4 turnovers, 4 sacks, 9 penalties) they still had 457
yards of total offense against arguably the best defense in the league and
were only one pass from winning this game. That said, it will be worth
monitoring how losing their All-Pro left tackle will affect that floor.

Negativity aside, this was a great game, with 5 lead changes and great play on
both sides of the ball. The Ravens rediscovered their identity in their run
game and were able to get out to an early lead after the pick-six. They even
put together a classic 4-minute drill to get a field goal right before the end
of the first half to put them up 17-7. Their defense also looked great in the
first half: only allowing 64 yards (only two passes completed for gain) and zero
offensive points.

The Steelers finally broke their scoring seal coming off Lamar’s second
interception, with a Big Ben pass to Eric Ebron. The lead was traded back and forth
until, with under eight minutes in the game, the Ravens had the
ball down by four. They fell back to what they do best and ran 10- straight
running plays to get to the Pittsburgh 8-yard line. _HOWEVA_, at the worst possible time,
Lamar coughs up his *second* red-zone fumble of the game. The Ravens find a way
to hem in the Steelers offense one more time, giving Lamar a final chance at
redemption. Driving 40 yards down the field with 3 seconds left, the Ravens had
a real shot at the end zone, but the Steelers defense came up big and secured
the win.
