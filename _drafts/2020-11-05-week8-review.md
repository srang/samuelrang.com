So obviously Tuesday 11/5 was an important day for ~America~ the World, *THE
NFL TRADE DEADLINE*! There weren’t too many earth shattering deals at the
eleventh hour, though there were some surprising names being whispered about -
Stephon Gilmore, Will Fuller - and some mid-tier deals done over the last
couple of weeks (:waving hand: :waving hand: Carlos -
https://www.nfl.com/news/bengals-de-carlos-dunlap-tweets-house-is-for-sale-amid-trade-reports).
We are also halfway through the NFL season! It’s crazy how time flies.

Some fun quick hits:

- The Bengals have a better record than the New England Patriots
- Tua won his first NFL start without having to do anything.
- Rams are 4-0 in the NFC East, but 1-3 outside the division (they are in the
  NFC West)
- The NFC East is 2-16 in non-divisional games making it more and more likely
  that there will be a playoff team with a losing record this year #2020
- The 49ers are, in fact, cursed losing both Kittle and Garoppolo for 6-8
  weeks, in addition to putting  Ayuik, Deebo, and starting left tackle Trent
  Williams on the COVID list this week
- This week in Arthur-Blank-looking-rich-on-the-sideline (maybe we aren't *all* Arthur Blank)
