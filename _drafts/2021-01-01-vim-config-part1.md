## Intro

This series has been years in the making and therefore warrants an introduction. I have been a vim
user for close to a decade, but it took a couple years before I became a _vim user_. I used it for
years as my primary Java editor, which I would say was a little overboard but still very functional.
I took a brief hiatus, moving to IntelliJ, which is a *FANTASTIC* development tool. Then I got promoted
to a non-technical role and didn't really do enough coding to warrant paying for a IDE.

Now, I'm here blogging and vim is the perfect mix of functionality for developing a Jekyll website
(blog series on that journey to follow), and to write blog posts. In this series I'll cover what
configuration I consider to be essential, what is a must have, and what I personally like.
