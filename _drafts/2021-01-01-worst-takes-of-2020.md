This will be a tough pill of a post to swallow but it needed
to be done. Here I will summarize all the ways (and degrees to which) I have
been wrong this season.

## The Patriots were still good

After the first week or two, I thought the Patriots had done what everyone had feared: 
Seamlessly transitioned out of the Brady era without missing a beat

## Minshew was a viable starter

## Russell for MVP


# Honorable Mention Good Takes

Rapid fire style

- Josh Allen bad stache
- Joe Burrow leading the Bengals out of the darkest timeline
