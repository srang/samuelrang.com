For those that missed it, the 2020 NFL season has drawn to a close, and the
2021 Offseason is in full swing. The time for reflection on a unique season has
come and gone and now we all look ahead with a mixture of optimism and
apprehension. In physics terms, the system is full of potential energy but the
outcome is uncertain. Without further ado, here are reasons for optimism and
pessimism for EVERY SINGLE TEAM (I missed this).

*NFC North*

:lion: Detroit Lions:

- Optimism: First Round Draft pick Penei Sewell is a physical embodiment of
  potential energy. He is a monster-human who has all football nerds on
  the edge of their seats. For a team at the beginning of a rebuild, he is a
  great foundational piece.
- Pessimism: It's easy to take pot-shots at Lions fans so I'll just leave folks
  with [this video](https://youtu.be/Ng8TV6buqqM?t=53), not negative, not
  positive, but it exists.

:bear: Chicago Bears:

- Optimism: In theory, you've found your QB of the future. And at least this
  time, you didn't pick him ahead of Patrick Mahomes.
- Pessimism: It's been a hot minute since Head Coach Matt Nagy won coach of the
  year, and this will be a pivotal year in deciding his place with this
  organization. The Jets can attest to the impact of having to swap coaching
  staffs in the middle of a promising young QB's tenure. Fingers crossed Matt
  figures out how to unlock this offense and his new QB.

:cheese wedge: Green Bay Packers:
- Optimism: As of today, you have an MVP quarterback on your roster. The Aaron
  Rogers Revenge Tour was glorious even if it didn't end in a Lombardi Trophy,
  and the core of that roster is still around.
- Pessimism: "As of today" is a very important caveat and the uncertainty around
  Aaron's status with the team is one of the biggest stories of the offseason
  (unfortunately for Packers fans).

:person: Minnesota Vikings:
- Optimism: Justin Jefferson and Dalvin Cook
- Pessimism: I feel like it's unfair to say Kirk Cousins, but my other option
  is the Defense which, under Zimmer, can't be as bad as last year... So, yeah,
  Kirk Cousins

*AFC North*

:tiger face: Cincinnati Bengals:

- Optimism: Joe Burrow is the Prince-Who-Was-Promised (you can't talk me out of
  that), and while there was a really fun meme this offseason on why the
  Bengals should have drafted [Sewell over Ja'Marr
  Chase](https://twitter.com/cincymeme/status/1378141842827587586), there is an
  argument to be made that Cincinnati has the deepest WR room in the AFC (don't
  @ me Tampa Bay).
- Pessimism: Well... there are a lot of directions I can go here but Zac Taylor
  is a generic polo wearing enigma. I have hope he can develop Joe but I think
  last year could have been an opportunity to bring in Burrow's LSU Offensive
  Coordinator, Joe Brady, to reset the franchise (again).

:dog face: Cleveland Browns:

- Pessimism: I'm flipping these for Cleveland because it tells a better story,
  but Cleveland has managed to win the NFL Offseason again. The biggest constant
  in franchise history is the ability to instill hope in the fanbase. And we
  know how far that has gone.
- Optimism: But this time it feels different. Baker may not be the straw that
  stirs the drink in The Land, but he's competent and has a better than average
  arm, and there are a lot of great young players on this team that will continue
  to get better and Holy Moly that offensive line.
