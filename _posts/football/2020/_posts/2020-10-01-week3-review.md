We're running it back. It's long overdue so without further ado, here is the NEWSLETTER!
There were some great matchups this week starting off with Thursday's game that 
included a 49.0 (!!!!) point showing by DJ Moore, which nearly doubled his total
points for the rest of the season combined!! 

On a fun note, Kelly asked during the Sunday morning game who we were cheering for, so 
I thought I'd throw together a "Watchability Ranking" of Non-Bengal teams we (I) want
to see win.

7. Jets - Zach Wilson is a much less compelling watch than Aaron Rodgers, especially
after the Hard Knocks glow-up but their Defense has a cast of characters that make 
this team worth cheering for.
6. Dolphins - Putting 70 on Sean Payton catapulted this team into the list. Plus
I'm partial
5. Vikings
4. Jaguars
3. Niners
2. Eagles
1. Lions - Dan Campbell is must watch TV and on both sides of the ball they have a
punishing line. Plus, again, they were on Hard Knocks....
