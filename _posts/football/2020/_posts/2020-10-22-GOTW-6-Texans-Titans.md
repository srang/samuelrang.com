The Titans entered the game as one of three unbeaten teams in the NFL, while
the Texans were riding the post-B.O’B. hype-wave with a win over the
_juggernaut_ Jaguars. The Titans proved on TuNF that they were still firing on
all cylinders despite their COVID hiatus, and they came out strong again this
week. They put up touchdowns on long demoralizing possessions on three of
their first four drives and went into halftime up 21-10. Derrick Henry looked
like a man among children blasting through the Texans defense who ranks in the
bottom quarter of the league in DVOA.

The third quarter, however, saw the Titans crumble like dried-out pumpkin
bread. The Texans scored 13 unanswered points while the Titans had a blocked
field goal, a lost fumble, and a missed field goal on consecutive drives.
_HOWEVA_, both of the Texans' touchdowns came on great field position, and
Tannehill still had shining moments mixed in, and while Henry completely
disappeared, only rushing for 14 yards in the quarter, you can never count him
out.

On the first play of Titans' first drive of the 4th, down by two on their
own 6-yard line, Derrick Henry broke off a NINETY-FOUR (94) yard touchdown run
where he proved he’s not only stronger than the entire Texans team but also
faster. And then they put salt in the wound with a two-point conversion. (This
is also when Scoragami started getting interesting, jumping to 16%). Instead of
rolling over, Deshaun Watson led the Texans on a two-play 75-yard TD drive.
*And then* the defense that had just been embarrassed 3 plays earlier picked
off a Tannehill deep ball, leading to a punishing 15-play, 7-minute touchdown
drive to put the Texans up by 7. And then something weird happened. Instead of
kicking the PAT to go up by 8, which would require the Titans to get a TD and
two-point conversion, the Texans went for 2 and failed to convert. Now,
Fairbairn did miss one extra point earlier in the game, and if they’d been able
to go up by 9 that would have completely iced the game but it still feels like
Romeo Crennel was daring fate with this one... and the Titans rose to the
challenge. Driving 76 yards down the field, the Titans tied the game with only
7 ticks on the clock. ONTO OVERTIME (this is also where we lost Scoragami
:disappointed:, it got to 87% which was thrilling).

Showing his versatility and maybe still feeling the sting of the third quarter,
Derrick Henry turned a 2nd-and-long screen pass into a 53-yard gain and took
the game into his presumably ginormous hands, and blasted a 3rd-and-goal
direct-snap in for a touchdown.

The Titans front office looks prophetic in running this team back from last year

(we are praying for you [@ChrisWesseling](https://twitter.com/chriswesseling)),
throwing for 366 yards, 4 TDs, and only 1 INT, combined with Henry showing
plenty of tread left on his tires with over 250 yards of offense and two TDs of
his own. Titans play the only other undefeated AFC team later this week.
