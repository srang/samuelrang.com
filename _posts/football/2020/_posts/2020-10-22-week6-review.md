Week 6 is now behind us, which means that we are almost halfway through the
fantasy regular season (time flies when you’re having fun)! There were a lot of
interesting games this week:

- We were 1:50 from a Scoragami in the [Texans-Titans game](https://twitter.com/NFL_Scorigami/status/1317917295101026305?s=20)
- An NFC East team won a game (and it was a NY team!!)
- The Falcons didn’t blow a lead
- Adam Gase, Doug Marone, Matt Patricia are all still NFL head coaches (at time of writing)
- I watched the Detroit game, but literally couldn’t come up with a hot take, and I’m not sure if I'm sorry
