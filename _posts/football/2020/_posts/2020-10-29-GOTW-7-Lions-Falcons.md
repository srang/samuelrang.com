:jack_o_lantern: Happy Halloween everyone! :jack_o_lantern: This week had some
_spookily_ good games. You know it's been a good week when the Game of the Week
*ISN’T*:

- The-three point game of the last undefeated teams in the AFC: [Steelers-Titans](https://www.nfl.com/games/steelers-at-titans-2020-reg-7)
- The overtime upset of the last undefeated team in the NFC: [Seahawks-Cardinals](https://www.nfl.com/games/seahawks-at-cardinals-2020-reg-7)
- The Joe Burrow Re:BOO (Battle of Ohio) game that featured four touchdowns in
  the fourth quarter alone: [BOO](https://www.nfl.com/games/browns-at-bengals-2020-reg-7)
- An absolutely crushing defeat of the much-maligned New England Patriots at the
  hands of the tin-cupping 49ers: [Patriots-49ers](https://www.nfl.com/games/49ers-at-patriots-2020-reg-7)

I’ll admit, I was extremely skeptical about a Falcons-Lions matchup trumping
all of those games above but _mea culpa_, this was a great game (though I have
no idea how in a game with nearly 800 yards of combined offense, neither team
broke 24 points).

This week saw the 2-3 Lions visiting the 1-5 beleaguered Falcons. The Lions
were coming off a post-bye-week victory over the ultimate get-right team, the
Jacksonville Jaguars, while the Falcons were still enjoying their
post-head-coach-firing-bump win (which was also their first win of the season)
over the everything-must-go Minnesota
[Vikings](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1319293591706095617?s=20)

This game had the slow start you might expect from two struggling teams, with
four three-and-out drives in the first quarter. One of the only redeeming plays
of the quarter (which to be fair, was a gem) was the 23-yard laser Matthew
Stafford threw to Marvin Jones Jr. on third-and-long, which led to the first
points of the game. It was also just the second third-down conversion of the
game, halfway through the first quarter (a diamond in the deep, deep rough).
The Falcons started the game with an early-down running strategy, handing off
to Gurley on their first 4 first-downs, but it was only when they broke that
pattern that they found the end zone, with Matty Ice throwing eight times on
the twelve-play, 79-yard drive. A drive where their four rushing attempts
amounted to ... _checks math_ ... 1 yard.

After that snoozefest of a first quarter, I was getting worried. _HOWEVA_, the
second quarter was the exact opposite. The Lions efficiently moved the ball
down the field, getting to the 3-yard line ... only to turn the ball over on
downs. No points, but at least more engaging. The Falcons responded, piecing
together a 14-play, 98-yard drive for a touchdown, seemingly icing the half
with 34 seconds left on the clock. Much to the surprise of everyone (and
foreshadowing), the Lions came back and orchestrated a near-perfect 48-yard
drive to get three points on the board before heading in for halftime, trailing
10-14.

After a very quiet third quarter, the fourth started with a missed field goal,
a zero-yard drive ending in a fumble, and a 1-yard drive ending in a field goal
(ending the nearly 20-minute scoring-drought). Not super thrilling, and not
very Game-of-the-Week-worthy, but I guess the _lack_ of scoring was at least
unique, which accurately describes the Falcons brand of football. The last
three minutes of this game were the exact opposite (high scoring), but also the
same (unique).

Down by two, the Falcons spent 2 minutes of clock to get the ball on the Lions’
12-yard line where, if managed correctly, they could run down the clock and
kick a game-winning field goal. _If managed correctly_. In what seemed like a
foolproof strategy, the Falcons handed the ball off to Todd Gurley from the
10-yard line, who up to that point had averaged under 2.5 per-carry on TWENTY
TWO CARRIES. Matt Ryan even said multiple times in the huddle, [“Don’t
score”](https://twitter.com/AndrewSiciliano/status/1321532878669275136?s=20).
Gurley scored. He was briefly wrapped up by the Lions safety, but he quickly
realized he was actively screwing the pooch and let go, and by then Gurley had
too much momentum to stop. In a bizarre scoring replay where the offense was
hoping for the touchdown to be called back (it wasn’t close), the Falcons had
managed to find yet another new way to let a team back into a game. After the
falcons completed a two-point conversion, the Lions got the ball back with just
over a minute left on the clock, down 16-22. Twice as much time as they needed
to score at the end of the first half, though this time without any timeouts.
Stafford put together an even more perfect drive, including three
clock-stopping spikes, getting the ball down to the 11-yard line. With 2
seconds left, Stafford dropped back, nimbly avoided being tripped up by his own
lineman, and delivered a dart to Hockenson for the winning TD (well technically
Prater had the winning PAT but still). Final Score: DET 23-22 ATL

While all of this final sequence was incredible, by far the best moment of this
comeback was Falcons owner Arthur Blank’s reaction on the sideline:
