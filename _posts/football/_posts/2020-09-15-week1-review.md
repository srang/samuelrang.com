*Football is BACK!* And it was glorious. Let’s just bask for a minute in
professional football being on TV again, in no particular order:

- The Browns are still bad but maybe Cody Parkey will solve their problems?
- The WFT shocked the world by being good
- The Patriots shocked no one by being good 
- The Bengals shocked *only* me by being bad (trending towards average… ONE OPI from a win)
- The Jaguars proved that you don’t have to be good to win
- The Bears have now won five straight matchups against Detroit, and the Trubisky legacy lives on!
- Old QBs can still ball
- Jerry Jones is jealous of the Ram’s new stadium
- It took until Tuesday morning before I noticed that the Cardinals actually won the game against
 the defending NFC champs. So much for the 49er's running things back
