Another week is in the books! We’ve had some surprise contenders emerge and
some off-season hopefuls turn into disappointments, it almost feels like a
normal football season!

It might not have been as good as the Battle of Ohio, but The Beard vs. The
Stache (and/or battle for East Coast of Florida...) was still fun. Minshew has
emerged this season as a surprisingly viable starting quarterback, and in this
Week 3 matchup, he out-distanced Fitz 246 to 156 in air yards but went
0-3 on fourth down conversions. Meanwhile, the Old Man and the Sea brought his
Fitz-<i>magic</i> to bear early with three touchdowns on their first three drives.
Miami wins 31-13.

The Bengals managed to find something more dissatisfying than a loss, tying the
Eagles 23-23. These are the same Eagles whose stadium-sound-team piped in
booing last week.

The Bears are the latest team to emerge like a phoenix from yet another Falcons
fourth quarter flame out. The Falcons gave up a 16 point lead in the fourth
quarter after the Bears benched Trubisky for Foles, and somehow the Bears are
3-0 on the season.

Gostkowski has redeemed himself from his 1-4 kicking performance in Week 1,
going 6 for 6 this week with kicks from 30, 31, 39, 51, 54, and 55 (!). Titans
seem to be having a surprising amount of success running things back from last
year, moving to 3-0 on the season, while Minnesota has lots of questions to
answer, sitting at 0-3.

Both New York teams STINK. That is all.

Seahawks and Packers are both rolling through their opponents this season, led
by their quarterbacks.

MNF was a matchup that came too early in the season but wasn’t as close as we
all hoped. Mahomes cooked, Ravens couldn’t keep up.
