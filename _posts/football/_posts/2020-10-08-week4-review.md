We have passed the quarter pole on the season and we had a great slate of games
this week!

*BENGALS WIN!!!* Three touchdowns and 151 yards from Joe Mixon after being
_HOSPITALIZED_ :dizzy_face: the night before with a chest injury. The Bengals
were able to get up by two scores late in the second half and after 3 weeks
of close games, they finally figured out how to control the clock on both sides
of the ball. This breaks their streak of losing one-score games and is the
longest stretch of unbeaten games in the Zac Taylor Era (they didn’t lose last
week!). Is Jacksonville tanking for Trevor? Who knows, but they are looking a
lot closer to the team we expected them to be this off-season.

:rotating_light: _COVID ALERT! COVID ALERT!_ :rotating_light:

We had our first major pandemic-related disruption this week. Not only did the
matchup between the Steelers and Titans get moved to Week 7, but a very late
positive test of Cam Newton pushed yet another
way-too-early-AFC-powerhouse-matchup (Chiefs-Patriots) to Monday night. The
game ended up being a defensive chess-match (really, _really_ low scoring).
After a 3-6 halftime score, each team scored an offensive touchdown in the
third quarter, but the real difference here was the Chiefs' defense winning the
turnover battle with a pick _and_ a pick-six in the fourth quarter (plus
another interception and fumble recovery earlier in the game). Chiefs win
26-10.

Tampa barely edged out LA in a shootout. With 20 years separating the ages of
the two starting quarterbacks, Herbert showed his mettle in his 3rd straight
start after LA lost Tyrod Taylor to a punctured lung. It looked like the
Chargers were going to run away with this game, going up 24-7, with the ball in
the last 30 seconds of the half. Unfortunately, they fumbled, allowing TB12
(Tompa Brady?) to find Mike Evans in the endzone right before halftime. The
second half was a showcase of stellar QB play but Tampa Bay got the win,
ending the game with an interception in the final three minutes.

The Browns gave Dallas the business for about two-and-a-half quarters on
Sunday, with 2 rushing touchdowns, and another two through the air including a
gadget play with Landry throwing a 37-yard laser to OBJ. HOWEVA, the domination
came to a screeching halt in the third quarter, when all of a sudden the Browns
offense evaporated, letting Dallas score 24 unanswered points including
THREE two-point conversions. Dak put up 502 yards and 4 touchdowns this week,
becoming the first player in NFL history to throw for 450+ yards in three
straight games, but even that wasn’t enough. This game had some crazy fun in
the last few minutes including a recovered blocked extra point by the Browns
and an interception to ice the game. Browns win 49-38.

Josh Allen had a shoulder injury scare (but didn’t technically miss a play). In
more relevant news, his facial hair game is actually worse than mine (who knew
such a thing was possible). Oh, and Bills are a legit 4-0 team; protect your
folding tables and condiments.

The Eagles came into the SNF tilt winless, but after upsetting the 49ers in
SF, they left atop the NFC East standings (yes that division is a
dumpster fire).

Football Czar Bill O’Brien gets the boot from Houston after an 0-4 start
including a loss to the previously winless and seemingly hopeless Vikings. Who
would have thought that B.O.B. would get the boot before Adam Gase?
